Everything else can be made by subclassing these core types.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two core types there are two other constants available in\r\nthe environment:\r\n\r\n  - `Huia` which provides access to runtime features (at this stage only\r\n     `requireFile:` and `requireCore:`).\r\n  - `Ruby` which implements a simple object proxy allowing you to encapsulate\r\n    a Ruby object and send and receive messages from them.  You will see that\r\n    a large amount of the standard library is implemented this way as it\r\n    evolves.\r\n\r\nA simple example:\r\n\r\n```huia\r\nStdout = Huia.requireCore: 'stdout'\r\n\r\nHelloWhom = Object.extend:\r\n\r\n  def: 'hello:' as: |whom|\r\n    Stdout.putString: \"Hello #{whom}\"\r\n\r\nhelloWhom = HelloWhom.create\r\nhelloWhom.hello: \"world\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther documentation is available on\r\n[the GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/jamesotron/Huia/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamesotron/Huia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesotron/Huia)\r\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jamesotron/Huia/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jamesotron/Huia)\r\n[![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/jamesotron/Huia/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jamesotron/Huia)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nHuia is distributed as a Rubygem, as such you can either place `gem \"huia\"` in\r\nyour `Gemfile` or run `bundle install huia`.  Huia will only run on Rubinius\r\nversion 2.2.10 and greater.  Sorry, but if you don't have a recent Rubinius\r\ninstalled, it's not going to work for you.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou can run Huia scripts using the bundled `huia` binary or interactively\r\nusing the interactive REPL, `hirb`.\r\n\r\n## Extinction of the Huia\r\n\r\nMelodious as its Māori name, the gentle Huia bird\r\nseems a fowl lost from an ancient bestiary.\r\n\r\nAlways in pairs, their life one long low liquid interchange,\r\nthey rarely flew, but hopped and probed in deepest thickets\r\npreening and balancing, antiphonal.\r\n\r\nThey fed upon the luscious huhu grub\r\nunder mossed and lichened podocarps\r\n— fed and hopped so lovingly together\r\nthat if a Māori noosed one bird, its mate would come to hand.\r\n\r\nWorking together, joint custodians, His straight crow-bar beak\r\nand Her thin curving probe, utterly unlike, conjoined\r\nto wingle out tree-eating grubs.\r\n\r\nNever widespread or numerous, their superb sober\r\nplumes made mourning-wear for centuries\r\nuntil Cook visited.  The stuffed ones soon\r\nwere 'musts' for lounge-rooms, though few knew\r\nhow well their natures fitted these strange bills.\r\n\r\nCharmed by his captive pair,\r\nBuller records how native know-how and the foreign gun\r\ntook in 600 skins from a week's work\r\n— most of the world's remaining stock:\r\n'Now safely on the increase'. A common bird today\r\nin Auckland's antique shops, its loving notes\r\nthat ranged from purest whistles to what seemed\r\na puppy's whining call, are gone, lost,\r\nall before the age of tapes and films.\r\nThe bird remains supreme in words\r\nof those who loved and stuffed it.\r\n\r\nAnd our museum has one — that is,\r\nof course, a pair.\r\n\r\n  — by Mark O'Connor.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
