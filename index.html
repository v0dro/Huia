<h2>
<a name="welcome-to-huia" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-huia"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Huia.</h2>

<p>Huia, is a programming language targetting the <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> VM.</p>

<p>Huia is a whitespace-aware dynamic language with a simple object model based
around traditional inheritance and closures.</p>

<p>Huia only has a few (global) constants for core types (such as Object, Closure.
Integer, etc).  Everything else can be made by subclassing these core types.</p>

<p>In addition to these two core types there are two other constants available in
the environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Huia</code> which provides access to runtime features (at this stage only
 <code>requireFile:</code> and <code>requireCore:</code>).</li>
<li>
<code>Ruby</code> which implements a simple object proxy allowing you to encapsulate
a Ruby object and send and receive messages from them.  You will see that
a large amount of the standard library is implemented this way as it
evolves.</li>
</ul><p>A simple example:</p>

<pre lang="huia"><code>Stdout = Huia.requireCore: 'stdout'

HelloWhom = Object.extend:

  def: 'hello:' as: |whom|
    Stdout.putString: "Hello #{whom}"

helloWhom = HelloWhom.create
helloWhom.hello: "world"
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Huia is distributed as a Rubygem, as such you can either place <code>gem "huia"</code> in
your <code>Gemfile</code> or run <code>bundle install huia</code>.  Huia will only run on Rubinius
version 2.2.10 and greater.  Sorry, but if you don't have a recent Rubinius
installed, it's not going to work for you.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>You can run Huia scripts using the bundled <code>huia</code> binary or interactively
using the interactive REPL, <code>hirb</code>.</p>

<p>Melodious as its Māori name, the gentle Huia bird
seems a fowl lost from an ancient bestiary.</p>

<p>Always in pairs, their life one long low liquid interchange,
they rarely flew, but hopped and probed in deepest thickets
preening and balancing, antiphonal.</p>

<p>They fed upon the luscious huhu grub
under mossed and lichened podocarps
— fed and hopped so lovingly together
that if a Māori noosed one bird, its mate would come to hand.</p>

<p>Working together, joint custodians, His straight crow-bar beak
and Her thin curving probe, utterly unlike, conjoined
to wingle out tree-eating grubs.</p>

<p>Never widespread or numerous, their superb sober
plumes made mourning-wear for centuries
until Cook visited.  The stuffed ones soon
were 'musts' for lounge-rooms, though few knew
how well their natures fitted these strange bills.</p>

<p>Charmed by his captive pair,
Buller records how native know-how and the foreign gun
took in 600 skins from a week's work
— most of the world's remaining stock:
'Now safely on the increase'. A common bird today
in Auckland's antique shops, its loving notes
that ranged from purest whistles to what seemed
a puppy's whining call, are gone, lost,
all before the age of tapes and films.
The bird remains supreme in words
of those who loved and stuffed it.</p>

<p>And our museum has one — that is,
of course, a pair.</p>
